# Learning Experience Readme

## Introduction

In this project we dive into building a podcast App that allows users to have show preview, with number of seasons and episodes of each season in the show. 

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: The objective of the project wast to provide a Podcast app that give users easy use and easy navigation, with an option to filter by genres or sort by alphabets and having their favourites stored
- for them to can go back when needed.
- **Technologies Used**: JavaScript React.

## Learning Experience

### Challenges Faced

1. **Completing users stories**: At first I challenged myself to complete every user stories , but i kept coming across lot of errors and took time for me to figure them out.
   
2. **Choosing UI**:I had a picture of how i wanted my podcast to look , and that alone was a challenge added as i struggled with which UI to use, also taking away form the time provided to finish the project,
3. as i had to go thru the documentation to understand how to use the UI.

4. . **Time Management**: The time provide for the project felt unreal to complete everything as i still struggle with quite a lot, the fustration of errors would get to me and that would lead to me spending a lot of time
5. focusing on one aspect.

### Solutions Found

1. **Completing users stories**: I opted to doing what i am able to do and complete ,so that i do not end up not having anything to show/submit, also i focused on the basics of what makes a podcast first.

2. **Choosing UI**:Proper research and asking for recommendations from those who have been in the industry longer than me and making a choice from the given recommendations to go with what i understand better.

### Insights Gained

1. **Patience is key**: This project gave me a clear understanding of "patience is virture"  Building a project this complex need one to be paitient and trust the process to get results, without patience is easy to give up
2. when still learning in the industry

3. **Problem-Solving Skills**: Understanding the problem clearly is important before you can even attenpt to solve, because if the problem is not clear and the are misunderstandings, that will create another problem. Read to understand
4. and understand the requirements from the user to become a good problem solver.

## Conclusion

Working on this project challenged both my paitience and curiosity, it gave an insight to the real world challenges we will face .I wish i had more time to work on the app.
